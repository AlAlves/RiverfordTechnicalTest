## Simplifications
* Much of the size-compute variables or colors code are written (not automatically generated).
* x-Position of bubbles within the bubble-graph are not really randomized.
* Bubble-graphe's x-Labels are not set with the name of the product.

## Clear Code
* JS script should be moved to another file if some code is added.
